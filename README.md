# MacroBomb

### How to Use
To use MacroBomb, first open the EXE program file (the program only works on Windows and Linux for now).

Once the program has started, it will ask you for the type of macro-spam you would like.  Answer with whatever is suitable for you needs.

After that, it will ask you for how much time should be in between each stroke.  This value must be a number (decimals are allowed as it is a floating number).

If you have selected a word or a key to be spammed, it will ask you what word/key to be typed or pressed.

When you complete all of these steps, you are all setup and can start using the macro right away.
P.S: you must keep the terminal windows open while using the macro.
